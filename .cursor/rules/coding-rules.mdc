Do not guess, if something is not in context, use tools to locate it.

Always create tests for all new components, and run tests on all edited components. These should by type accurate, and focus on testing cohesion and purpose.

When creating new features, always enforce SoC. If a file doesn't seem to need this logic in it to function directly, try to separate concerns. Do not break patterns, just focus on reusability.

Always check that changes will not break old implementations.

Always use patterns from the file when editing.ÃŸ
