When making changes to `database.js` with the current `vectordb` package:

1. **Do not use** `collection.query()` or `collection.scan()` methods as they don't exist
2. Always use the workaround with `search()` method for listing all items
3. Ensure any new vector operations are compatible with the vectordb v0.4.3 API
4. When adding new functions that fetch data, follow the pattern of the working methods

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter errors with the database operations:

1. Check the LanceDB/vectordb package version in package.json
2. Verify that you're using the compatible API methods for that version
3. For operations that aren't working, check if the method exists by inspecting the collection object
4. If needed, use workarounds similar to the one in `listItems`
