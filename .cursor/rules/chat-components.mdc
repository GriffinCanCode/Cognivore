# Chat Component Architecture

The application has recently transitioned to a chat-based interface as the primary UI.

## Key Components
- `ChatUI.js` - Main chat container component
- `ChatInput.js` - Handles user input and message submission
- `ChatMessages.js` - Displays message history
- `App.js` - Main application component that coordinates UI components

## Considerations
- Always ensure proper binding of methods in class components (e.g., `this.methodName = this.methodName.bind(this)`)
- Messages should be properly validated before submission
- Input state should be cleared after message submission
- Ensure components don't duplicate UI elements like headers/footers
- Verify DOM updates with proper container references and lifecycle handling

## Styling
- Chat interface uses a modern glassmorphism design with dark mode support
- Message bubbles have distinct user/assistant appearances with hover effects
- Components use separate CSS files in `frontend/public/styles/components/`
