Always add changes in short summaries to [changelog.md](mdc:internal/docs/plans/changelog.md), don't add simple small changes. Add descriptions of all new files, with patterns but extremely abbreviated. Ensure that these make future tracking and implementation easier.

Always add DEBUG logs to [debuglog.md](mdc:internal/docs/plans/debuglog.md), DO NOT add them to the general changelog. This will bloat our changelog.

ALWAYS put new entries at the top NOT THE BOTTOM.
