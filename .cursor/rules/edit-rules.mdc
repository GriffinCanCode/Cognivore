Always check [test-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/test-rules.mdc) first before edits, and ensure you test components that are added and add tests for new ones.

Make sure edits always are relevant to the tech stack, for example, do not use new implementation patterns for libraries that in this project are using older versions.
