# Backend Communication

The application uses both IPC and HTTP for frontend-backend communication.

## Communication Patterns
- Primary: IPC (Inter-Process Communication) via Electron
- Fallback: HTTP for environments where IPC is unavailable

## IPC Handlers
- Centralized in `backend/src/ipcHandlers.js`
- Initialized from the main process in `frontend/src/main.js`
- Channels include health checks, config, chat, and tool execution

## Frontend Integration
- `frontend/src/preload.js` exposes IPC communication to the renderer process
- Communication prioritizes IPC over HTTP fallback
- Error handling includes proper feedback for connection issues

## Common Issues
- Port mismatches between frontend and backend (3000 vs 3001)
- IPC connection failures requiring HTTP fallback
- Timeout handling for backend requests
- Error handling for detached or missing DOM elements

Always ensure proper error handling and fallback mechanisms when modifying communication code.
