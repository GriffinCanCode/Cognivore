# Step-by-Step Plan for Stage 2: Core Interaction - Search & Basic User Interface

## 1. Semantic Search Implementation
- [ ] Define IPC channel for search query input
- [ ] Implement query embedding generation using sentence transformer
- [ ] Create vector database similarity search function
- [ ] Format search results with relevant text chunks and metadata
- [ ] Set up IPC channel to return results to renderer

## 2. User Interface Development
- [ ] Design main application window layout:
  - [ ] Create sidebar for navigation/actions
  - [ ] Implement main content area

- [ ] Build Content Ingestion UI:
  - [ ] Design "Add Content" panel with file picker and URL inputs
  - [ ] Implement IPC calls to trigger ingestion functions
  - [ ] Add loading indicators and success/error messages

- [ ] Develop Knowledge Library View:
  - [ ] Create list component to display all stored items
  - [ ] Show key metadata for each item
  - [ ] Implement item selection functionality

- [ ] Implement Content Viewing Area:
  - [ ] Display full extracted text of selected item
  - [ ] Show relevant metadata for selected item

- [ ] Create Search Interface:
  - [ ] Add prominent search bar component
  - [ ] Implement search submission via IPC
  - [ ] Design results display with clear, scrollable list
  - [ ] Enable clicking results to load full content

- [ ] Add Item Management UI:
  - [ ] Create delete button/function for items
  - [ ] Implement IPC call to deletion backend
  - [ ] Update UI after successful deletion

## 3. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Write UI component tests
- [ ] Create IPC integration tests for all main functions
- [ ] Perform end-to-end user scenario tests
- [ ] Conduct basic usability testing
