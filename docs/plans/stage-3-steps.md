# Step-by-Step Plan for Stage 3: Initial AI-Powered Insights & Polish

## 1. "Relevant Snippets" Agent Implementation
- [ ] Review existing search functionality for agent activation
- [ ] Enhance display of search results for clarity and usefulness
- [ ] Add source document indicators for each snippet
- [ ] Implement highlighting of search terms in snippets
- [ ] Make number of returned snippets configurable

## 2. UI/UX Refinement & Polish
- [ ] Review all UI elements against design philosophy
- [ ] Address areas of confusion or inefficiency in user flow
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling across the application
- [ ] Improve visual hierarchy and readability
- [ ] Enhance error messages to be more user-friendly
- [ ] Add clear visual feedback for ongoing operations
- [ ] Implement graceful handling of edge cases
- [ ] Add basic sorting options to library view
- [ ] Consider basic filtering by source type
- [ ] Ensure adequate color contrast for accessibility
- [ ] Check keyboard navigability of key UI elements

## 3. Cross-Platform Considerations & Build Process
- [ ] Test application on target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Fix platform-specific UI glitches or inconsistencies
- [ ] Configure Electron Forge/Builder for distributable packages
- [ ] Test packaged application installation and running
- [ ] Ensure correct packaging of local models and dependencies

## 4. Final Testing & MVP Validation
- [ ] Re-test all features from previous stages
- [ ] Test user workflows from ingestion to retrieval
- [ ] Assess application responsiveness
- [ ] Identify major performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Check for memory leaks or crashes during extended use
- [ ] Verify data persistence across application restarts
- [ ] Validate against MVP success metrics
- [ ] Create README with installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Document known limitations of the MVP
