# Stage 3: Initial AI-Powered Insights & Polish

**Overall Goal:** Introduce the first AI-driven assistance feature ("Relevant Snippets" Agent) and refine the overall user experience, ensuring the MVP is stable, intuitive, and meets its core objectives.

**Key Sections from `plan.md`:** 4.D (AI-Powered Insights - Initial), remaining parts of 4.E (User Interface & Experience), 7 (Success Metrics)

---

## I. "Relevant Snippets" Agent Implementation

1.  **Agent Trigger/Invocation:**
    *   Rule: Determine how the "Relevant Snippets" agent is activated. Initially, this can be synonymous with the existing search functionality (as per `plan.md` "When a user initiates a search or asks a question").
    *   Rule: Ensure the existing search mechanism (Stage 2, Section II & III.E) serves this purpose by presenting the top N relevant text segments.
2.  **Refine Snippet Presentation:**
    *   Rule: Review and enhance the display of search results (snippets) to be clear, concise, and directly useful as "assisted recall."
    *   Rule: Ensure that each snippet clearly indicates its source document/video.
    *   Rule: Consider highlighting the search terms within the snippets if feasible and helpful.
3.  **Configuration for "Top N":**
    *   Rule: Allow the number of returned snippets (N) to be configurable (e.g., a setting in the main process, defaulting to a reasonable number like 3-5).

## II. UI/UX Refinement & Polish

1.  **Design Philosophy Adherence:**
    *   Rule: Review all UI elements and workflows against the "Clean, intuitive, and efficient" design philosophy.
    *   Rule: Identify and address any areas of clunkiness, confusion, or inefficiency in the user flow.
2.  **Visual Consistency and Appeal:**
    *   Rule: Ensure consistent styling (fonts, colors, spacing, iconography) across the application.
    *   Rule: Improve visual hierarchy and readability.
3.  **Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   Rule: Enhance error messages to be more user-friendly and informative.
    *   Rule: Provide clear visual feedback for ongoing operations (e.g., loading states during ingestion or search).
    *   Rule: Handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., empty search results, failed file processing).
4.  **Sorting and Filtering (Basic):**
    *   Rule: If not already present, consider adding basic sorting options to the main library view (e.g., by date added, by title).
    *   Rule: Consider basic filtering by source type in the library view.
5.  **Accessibility Considerations (Basic):**
    *   Rule: Ensure adequate color contrast.
    *   Rule: Check for keyboard navigability of key UI elements.

## III. Cross-Platform Considerations & Build Process

1.  **Testing on Target Platforms:**
    *   Rule: Test the application on Windows, macOS, and Linux (or the primary target platforms for MVP).
    *   Rule: Identify and fix any platform-specific UI glitches or behavioral inconsistencies.
2.  **Build and Packaging:**
    *   Rule: Configure Electron Forge, Electron Builder, or a similar tool to create distributable application packages for target platforms.
    *   Rule: Test the packaged application to ensure it installs and runs correctly.
3.  **Local Model/Dependency Management:**
    *   Rule: Ensure any locally run models (e.g., sentence transformers) are packaged correctly or that clear instructions are provided for their setup if they are too large for packaging. Consider ONNX runtime for better compatibility if not already chosen.

## IV. Final Testing & MVP Validation

1.  **Comprehensive Feature Testing:**
    *   Rule: Re-test all features from Stage 1 and Stage 2, ensuring they work cohesively with Stage 3 enhancements.
    *   Rule: Focus on user workflows from content ingestion to knowledge retrieval.
2.  **Performance Testing (Basic):**
    *   Rule: Assess the application's responsiveness, especially during search and ingestion of moderately sized content.
    *   Rule: Identify any major performance bottlenecks for potential post-MVP optimization.
3.  **Stability and Data Persistence:**
    *   Rule: Run the application for extended periods, performing various actions to check for memory leaks or crashes.
    *   Rule: Verify that all data is consistently and reliably saved and loaded across application restarts.
4.  **Meet MVP Success Metrics:**
    *   Rule: Validate against the success metrics defined in `plan.md` (Section 7):
        *   User can successfully ingest and process supported content types (PDF, Web, YouTube).
        *   User can perform semantic searches and retrieve relevant information quickly.
        *   Application is stable, and data is persistently stored.
        *   Users report ease of use in managing their basic knowledge items (informal feedback or self-assessment).
5.  **Basic Documentation:**
    *   Rule: Create a simple README file or internal documentation outlining:
        *   How to install and run the application.
        *   A brief overview of its features and how to use them.
        *   Any known limitations of the MVP.

**Definition of Done for Stage 3 (MVP Completion):**
*   The "Relevant Snippets" agent (via enhanced search) effectively presents relevant text segments.
*   The UI/UX has been reviewed and polished for intuitiveness and efficiency.
*   Error handling and user feedback are robust.
*   The application has been tested on target cross-platform environments.
*   A build and packaging process is in place.
*   All MVP features are stable, and data is persistently stored.
*   The application meets the defined MVP success metrics.
*   Basic user/developer documentation is created.
*   The MVP is ready for initial user testing or internal use.
