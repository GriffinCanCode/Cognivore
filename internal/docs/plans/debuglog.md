# Debug Log

## 2025-01-15 - DEBUG: Fixed Dual TabBar Rendering Conflict

### Fixed Dual React Rendering
- **CRITICAL**: Eliminated dual TabBar rendering that was causing React DOM insertion conflicts
  - **Issue**: TabBar was being rendered BOTH via ReactDOM.createRoot in TabBarRenderer AND as React component in main Voyager render method
  - **Fix**: Removed TabBar from main Voyager render method, keeping only TabBarRenderer approach
  - **Result**: Eliminated "Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node'" errors during component initialization

### Enhanced TabManagerButton DOM Stability
- **Added**: Additional 150ms stabilization delay (50ms + 100ms) before enabling React portals in TabManagerButton
- **Enhanced**: More defensive portal creation checks to prevent DOM insertion conflicts
- **Improved**: Error recovery with retry functionality for better user experience

### Debugging Process
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Multiple React roots creating simultaneous DOM operations during browser initialization
- **Solution Approach**: Eliminated competing render paths and added defensive timing delays
- **Testing Results**: Component now initializes without React DOM conflicts
