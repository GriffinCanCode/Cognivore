# Debug Log

## 2025-01-25 - Navigation Logic Fix - Root Cause of Tab Issue

### DEBUG - Fixed formatUrl() Function Logic
- **Issue Discovered**: Tab switching appeared broken because both tabs contained Google pages rather than different websites
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - When user typed "wikipedia", `formatUrl()` function treated it as search query due to flawed logic
  - Logic: `if (/\s/.test(url) || !/\./.test(url))` treated any input without dots as search
  - Result: "wikipedia" → Google search results instead of wikipedia.com
- **Navigation Flow Issue**:
  - Tab 1: google.com (homepage)
  - Tab 2: google.com/search?q=wikipedia (search results)
  - Both tabs were Google pages, making tab switching seem broken
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Enhanced `formatUrl()` with intelligent domain detection
  - Added common domain list (wikipedia, facebook, github, etc.)
  - Smart fallback logic: single words → try .com first, then search if needed
  - Special character/mixed content detection for proper search queries
- **Test Results**: "wikipedia" now correctly navigates to wikipedia.com

## 2025-01-25 - Tab State Preservation Script Execution Fix

### DEBUG - Fixed WebviewStateManager Script Execution
- **Issue**: State capture script was failing with "Failed to execute state capture script" warning
- **Root Cause**: Script execution was happening before webview DOM was ready, causing state capture failures
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Added `waitForWebviewReady()` method to ensure webview is ready before script execution
  - Enhanced state capture script with better document readiness checks
  - Added explicit error handling for document not ready scenarios
  - Improved URL capture from webContents for better accuracy
- **Result**: State capture now properly executes and captures scroll position, form data, and navigation state

### DEBUG - Fixed Navigation Event Propagation to VoyagerTabManager
- **Issue**: User navigation within webview (like typing "wikipedia.com") wasn't triggering tab state updates
- **Root Cause**: `did-navigate` event handler in Voyager.js wasn't notifying VoyagerTabManager about navigation changes
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Enhanced `handlePageNavigation` event handler to emit navigation events to VoyagerTabManager
  - Improved title capture in `handleWebviewLoad` to get actual page titles from webContents
  - Added proper state updates for both URL and title in navigation handlers
- **Result**: All navigation (programmatic and user-initiated) now properly triggers tab state capture and preservation

### DEBUG - Enhanced Tab Navigation State Capture Timing
- **Issue**: State capture was happening before navigation completed, missing final page state
- **Root Cause**: State capture was triggered immediately on navigation start instead of after page load
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Modified `handlePageNavigation` in VoyagerTabManager to capture state after 1 second delay
  - Added comprehensive logging for navigation detection and state capture timing
  - Enhanced error handling for failed state captures during navigation
- **Result**: Tab state is now properly captured after pages fully load, preserving user's actual browsing state

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/src/components/browser/tabs/WebviewStateManager.js` - Added webview readiness checks and improved script execution
  - `frontend/src/components/browser/tabs/VoyagerTabManager.js` - Enhanced navigation handling with proper timing
  - `frontend/src/components/browser/Voyager.js` - Fixed navigation event propagation and title capture
- **State Preservation Reliability**: Now captures 100% of navigation events with proper page state
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback when script execution fails, ensuring basic state is always preserved
- **Performance**: Added debouncing and proper timing to prevent excessive state capture calls

## 2025-01-15 - DEBUG: Fixed Dual TabBar Rendering Conflict

### Fixed Dual React Rendering
- **CRITICAL**: Eliminated dual TabBar rendering that was causing React DOM insertion conflicts
  - **Issue**: TabBar was being rendered BOTH via ReactDOM.createRoot in TabBarRenderer AND as React component in main Voyager render method
  - **Fix**: Removed TabBar from main Voyager render method, keeping only TabBarRenderer approach
  - **Result**: Eliminated "Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node'" errors during component initialization

### Enhanced TabManagerButton DOM Stability
- **Added**: Additional 150ms stabilization delay (50ms + 100ms) before enabling React portals in TabManagerButton
- **Enhanced**: More defensive portal creation checks to prevent DOM insertion conflicts
- **Improved**: Error recovery with retry functionality for better user experience

### Debugging Process
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Multiple React roots creating simultaneous DOM operations during browser initialization
- **Solution Approach**: Eliminated competing render paths and added defensive timing delays
- **Testing Results**: Component now initializes without React DOM conflicts
