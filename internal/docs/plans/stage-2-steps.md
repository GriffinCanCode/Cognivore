# Step-by-Step Plan for Stage 2: Core Interaction - Search & Basic User Interface

## 1. Semantic Search Implementation
- [x] Define IPC channel for search query input
- [x] Implement query embedding generation using sentence transformer
- [x] Create vector database similarity search function
- [x] Format search results with relevant text chunks and metadata
- [x] Set up IPC channel to return results to renderer

## 2. User Interface Development
- [x] Design main application window layout:
  - [x] Create sidebar for navigation/actions
  - [x] Implement main content area

- [x] Build Content Ingestion UI:
