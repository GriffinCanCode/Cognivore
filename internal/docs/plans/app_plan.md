**Project Title:** Knowledge Store

**1. Vision & Mission:**

* **Vision:** To empower individuals to effortlessly capture, connect, and rediscover their personal knowledge, transforming scattered information into actionable insights.
* **Mission:** To develop an intuitive desktop application that serves as a persistent, private, and intelligent personal knowledge base, supporting various media types and offering AI-driven assistance for learning and productivity.

**2. Core Problem Addressed:**

* Information overload and the difficulty of retaining and recalling knowledge from diverse sources (articles, videos, documents).
* Valuable insights from past consumption are often lost or hard to retrieve when needed for current tasks.
* Lack of a centralized, searchable, and intelligent system for personal learning and work-related materials.

**3. Target User:**

* Knowledge workers, researchers, students, lifelong learners, and anyone who consumes a significant amount of digital information and wants to leverage it more effectively.

**4. Key Features (MVP Focus):**

* **A. Content Ingestion & Processing:**
    * **Supported File Types (Initial):**
        * PDF documents: Text extraction.
        * Web pages (via URL): Article text extraction (reader mode equivalent).
        * YouTube videos (via URL): Automated fetching of available transcripts.
    * **Mechanism:**
        * Simple user interface for adding content (e.g., "Add File," "Add URL").
        * Automatic text extraction and pre-processing upon ingestion.
        * Generation of vector embeddings for ingested text.
* **B. Knowledge Storage & Management:**
    * **Database:** Local NoSQL Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB, Qdrant in-memory/local file, LanceDB).
        * Ensures data privacy and offline access.
        * Stores original text (or reference to local file for PDFs), extracted text, metadata (source URL, title, type), and vector embeddings.
    * **Persistence:** Data reliably saved locally on the user's machine.
    * **Basic Management:**
        * List view of all stored items.
        * Ability to view item details (metadata, extracted text).
        * Ability to delete items from the knowledge base.
* **C. Search & Retrieval:**
    * **Semantic Search:** Users can search their knowledge base using natural language queries.
    * The system will return the most relevant chunks of text from their stored content based on vector similarity.
    * Display of search results with snippets and links to the full stored item.
* **D. AI-Powered Insights (Initial - "Assisted Recall"):**
    * **"Relevant Snippets" Agent:** When a user initiates a search or asks a question related to their work:
        * The agent performs a semantic search on the vector database.
        * It presents the top N most relevant text segments from their stored documents/videos.
        * Focus on surfacing existing knowledge rather than complex generation for MVP.
* **E. User Interface & Experience (Electron App):**
    * **Platform:** Cross-platform Desktop Application (Windows, macOS, Linux) using Electron.
    * **Design Philosophy:** Clean, intuitive, and efficient. Focus on ease of use for adding content and retrieving information.
    * **Key UI Elements:**
        * Content ingestion panel/modal.
        * Main library view (list of knowledge items with sorting/filtering).
        * Search bar for semantic queries.
        * Results display area (showing snippets and source).
        * Content viewing area (displaying full text of selected item).

**5. Technical Stack (Proposed - flexible):**

* **Frontend:** Electron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte for UI structure).
* **Backend Logic (within Electron's main process or a local server packaged with the app):** Node.js or Python.
    * Handles file processing, interaction with the vector DB, embedding generation logic.
* **Vector Database:** Local/embeddable solution (e.g., ChromaDB, Qdrant, LanceDB).
* **Text Extraction:** Libraries like `pdf-parse` (for PDFs), `Mozilla Readability` or similar (for web pages).
* **Embedding Models:** Sentence Transformers (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) run locally or via a lightweight local inference engine if feasible. (Consider ONNX runtime for cross-platform compatibility and performance if using local models).
* **YouTube Transcript Fetching:** Utilize libraries like `youtube-transcript` or direct calls to YouTube APIs (if adhering to ToS).

**6. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):**

* **Advanced AI Insights:** Summarization across multiple documents, question-answering over the knowledge base, thematic analysis, proactive suggestions.
* **More Data Sources:** HTML files, plain text files, Markdown, EPUBs, audio file transcription.
* **Browser Extension:** For quick saving of web content.
* **Tagging & Categorization:** Manual and AI-assisted organization.
* **Knowledge Graph Visualization:** To see connections between information.
* **OCR for Image-based PDFs or Images.**
* **Synchronization (Optional & Secure):** Secure cloud sync between user's devices.
* **More sophisticated AI agent interactions.**

**7. Success Metrics (for MVP):**

* User can successfully ingest and process supported content types.
* User can perform semantic searches and retrieve relevant information quickly.
* Application is stable and data is persistently stored.
* Users report ease of use in managing their basic knowledge items.

**8. Call to Action/Next Steps (using this outline):**

* **Detailed Feature Breakdown:** Expand each MVP feature into specific user stories and technical tasks.
* **Technology Prototyping:** Test chosen vector DB, embedding models, and text extraction libraries.
* **UI/UX Design Mockups:** Create wireframes and mockups for the core user interface.
* **Development Roadmap:** Plan sprints or development cycles for building the MVP.
