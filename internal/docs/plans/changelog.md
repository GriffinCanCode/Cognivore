### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed dual browser instantiation and React ref timing issues in App.js
  - Removed direct browser instantiation (`this.browser = new Browser()`) in favor of React-only approach
  - Fixed `React.createElement()` to use imported `Browser` class directly instead of `this.browser.constructor`
  - Updated all navigation and cleanup logic to use `this.browserRef.current` instead of `this.browser`
  - Set `containerRef` immediately when creating browser container, not in setTimeout
  - Ensured containerRef is available when Voyager component's `componentDidMount()` fires
  - Eliminated race condition where React component tried to initialize before containerRef was set
  - Simplified browser lifecycle management by using single React-managed instance
  - Reduced backup containerRef timeout from 100ms to 10ms since primary timing is now fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed VoyagerLifecycle DOM readiness check causing webview creation failures after navigation
  - Enhanced `isDomReadyForBrowser()` function in `VoyagerLifecycle.js` with more resilient DOM connectivity detection
  - Added multiple fallback checks: `isConnected`, `document.contains()`, `parentNode`, and `parentElement` validation
  - Added DOM property validation to ensure container has basic DOM functionality (`tagName`, `appendChild`)
  - Improved error logging with comprehensive DOM state debugging information
  - Reduced initialization retry attempts from 8 to 5 and retry delays from 150ms to 100ms base since DOM checking is more robust
  - Fixed race condition where container passed initial readiness check but failed VoyagerLifecycle validation
  - Restored immediate initialization in `componentDidMount()` with minimal 50ms delay for React rendering completion
  - Browser now successfully creates webview and navigates to Google on first load and refresh

### Technical Details
- Root cause: VoyagerLifecycle DOM readiness check was more strict than Voyager initialization check, causing validation mismatch
- Solution: Enhanced both systems with consistent, comprehensive DOM connectivity validation
- Reduced reliance on timing delays in favor of robust DOM state checking
- Maintains existing retry system as fallback while making primary path more reliable

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed Voyager browser first-load initialization timing issue
  - Enhanced `componentDidMount()` in `Voyager.js` with proper DOM readiness detection
  - Added `requestAnimationFrame()` + `setTimeout()` combination to ensure DOM is fully painted and settled
  - Increased initial DOM settling delay from 0ms to 100ms for more reliable first-load initialization
  - Reduced retry attempts from 10 to 8 and retry delays from 200ms to 150ms base since initial timing is now more reliable
  - Added comprehensive DOM readiness logging to distinguish between immediate success and retry scenarios
  - Prevents "Cannot initialize Voyager - container not mounted" error on fresh application loads
  - Maintains perfect reload behavior while fixing first-load race condition

### Technical Details
- Root cause: React componentDidMount fired before DOM container was fully connected on first load
- Solution: Two-phase DOM readiness check (requestAnimationFrame → setTimeout → container validation)
- Maintains existing retry system as fallback for edge cases
- Improved user experience by eliminating 200ms delay on first browser navigation

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed race condition in Voyager browser initialization causing partial renders on page reload
  - Enhanced `VoyagerLifecycle.js` with DOM readiness checks and proper state tracking
  - Added `browserStateTracker` Map to prevent initialization conflicts between React lifecycle and VoyagerLifecycle
  - Implemented proper coordination between React component mount/unmount and VoyagerLifecycle state
  - Added `resetBrowserState()` function to clean up tracking state on component unmount
  - Modified `Voyager.js` to force fresh initialization after component remount following navigation
  - Reduced initial webview creation delay from 100ms to 50ms for faster startup
  - Added comprehensive DOM connectivity checks before webview creation attempts
  - Ensures browser renders immediately and fully on all navigation scenarios including URL changes with trailing slashes

### Technical Details
- Files modified: `VoyagerLifecycle.js`, `Voyager.js`
- Added global state tracking to prevent race conditions while maintaining SoC
- Enhanced retry logic with proper cleanup checks during component lifecycle transitions
- Implemented forced state reset mechanism for fresh mounts after navigation

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed webview initialization timing issue causing navigation failures on first load
  - **Root Cause**: Navigation was attempted immediately after webview creation but before `dom-ready` event fired
  - **Symptom**: "The WebView must be attached to the DOM and the dom-ready event emitted before this method can be called" error
  - **Solution**: Added `_setupInitialNavigation()` method that waits for `dom-ready` event before attempting navigation
  - **Enhanced Safety**: Added 3-second fallback timeout and retry logic for edge cases
  - **Result**: Browser now loads correctly on first initialization without requiring refresh
  - **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/components/browser/Voyager.js`
  - **Methods Added**: `_setupInitialNavigation()`, `_performInitialNavigation()`
  - **Event Handling**: Added one-time `dom-ready` event listener for proper webview readiness detection

### Technical Details
- Replaced immediate `this.navigate('https://www.google.com')` call with event-driven approach
- Enhanced webview readiness detection with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Prevented "Navigation timeout reached" errors by ensuring webview is ready before navigation
- Maintained backward compatibility while fixing the race condition between webview creation and navigation

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed conflicting CSS styles preventing webview from rendering properly after initial navigation
  - **Root Cause**: StyleManager.safeApplyStyles was applying `display: block` while other styling methods used `display: flex`, causing conflicting styles
  - **Multiple Style Applications**: handleWebviewLoad was calling multiple redundant styling methods that fought each other
  - **Solution**: Made StyleManager consistent by using `display: flex` and simplified handleWebviewLoad to use single styling method
  - **Result**: Webview now renders immediately and consistently on first navigation without style conflicts
  - **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/components/browser/handlers/StyleManager.js`, `frontend/src/components/browser/Voyager.js`
  - **Impact**: Eliminates white screen and partial rendering issues that were occurring after successful navigation

### Technical Details
- Changed StyleManager.safeApplyStyles from `display: block !important` to `display: flex !important`
- Removed redundant style applications in Voyager.handleWebviewLoad (applyWebviewStyles, applyAllCriticalStyles, direct style overrides)
- Consolidated to single safeApplyCriticalStyles call for consistent styling
- Maintains webview navigation functionality while fixing rendering consistency

  - Created isolated callback functions that don't capture browser object references in their closure
  - Ensured all props passed to React components are completely serializable (no DOM references, no functions with closures)

- **Webview Styling**: Applied simple, effective webview styling that works with CSS positioning

## [2024-12-26] Critical Browser Navigation Timeout Fix

### Fixed
- **Navigation Timeout Issue**: Fixed critical issue where "Navigation timeout reached, hiding loading content" message appeared after 8 seconds even when pages loaded successfully
- **Root Cause**: The `handleWebviewLoad` function in EventHandlers.js was not clearing the navigation timeout set in the `navigate` method, causing timeout to always fire
