- Standardized error handling with detailed error logging
- Enhanced debug information for text processing and embeddings
- Implemented trace-level logging for fine-grained debugging
- Improved metadata in log entries for better debugging and monitoring
- Updated config bootstrapping with temporary logger

## [0.1.3] - 2025-05-20

### Enhanced
- Improved backend logger with millisecond timestamp precision for detailed debugging
- Enhanced context handling by passing it as metadata for better log filtering
- Added circular reference detection to prevent logger crashes
- Enhanced HTTP logger with intelligent log level selection based on response status and time
- Added user-agent summary tracking to HTTP logger for better request identification
- Improved sensitive data redaction to handle nested objects
- Added generic log method for interface compatibility
- Exported log levels for reference in other parts of the application

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed logger configuration in frontend/src/utils/logger.js to use an array for levels instead of an object, resolving "this.levels.includes is not a function" error.
- Fixed console transport format in frontend logger to handle undefined date property, resolving "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toISOString')" error.
- Replaced custom format function with electron-log's standard format string to resolve "data.reduce is not a function" error in style transformation.
- Updated deprecated `archiveLog` to `archiveLogFn` in file transport configuration to resolve deprecation warning.
- Fixed preload script issues by removing dependency on path module and simplifying logger initialization in sandboxed context.
- Modified logger.js to improve compatibility with Electron's preload script sandboxing restrictions.
- Implemented inline logger in preload.js to avoid CommonJS module dependencies, addressing sandbox restrictions in Electron 20+.
- Fixed "items.forEach is not a function" error in displayItems by properly handling the response object structure from IPC calls.
