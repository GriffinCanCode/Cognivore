- Tests for both frontend and backend loggers

### Changed
- Updated backend and frontend entry points to use structured logging
- Added preload API for renderer process logging
- Extended config with logging settings
- Refactored services to use contextual loggers

## [0.1.2]

### Changed
- Integrated proper contextual logging across all backend services
- Standardized error handling with detailed error logging
- Enhanced debug information for text processing and embeddings
- Implemented trace-level logging for fine-grained debugging
- Improved metadata in log entries for better debugging and monitoring
- Updated config bootstrapping with temporary logger

## [0.1.3]

### Enhanced
- Improved backend logger with millisecond timestamp precision for detailed debugging
- Enhanced context handling by passing it as metadata for better log filtering
- Added circular reference detection to prevent logger crashes
- Enhanced HTTP logger with intelligent log level selection based on response status and time
- Added user-agent summary tracking to HTTP logger for better request identification
- Improved sensitive data redaction to handle nested objects
- Added generic log method for interface compatibility
- Exported log levels for reference in other parts of the application

## [0.1.4]

### Added
- Created `backend/src/utils/tempFileManager.js`: Modular utility for managing temporary files
  - Provides consistent temp file path handling
  - Includes safe file deletion with error handling
  - Features TempFileHandler class for complex file patterns
  - Supports fallback locations for files created outside temp directory
  - Handles cleanup of temporary files automatically
- Implemented batch processing system for efficient document processing and embedding
  - Created `backend/src/utils/batchers/batchProcessor.js`: Generic batch processing utility with concurrency control
  - Created `backend/src/utils/batchers/chunkerBatch.js`: Batch processing for text chunking operations
  - Created `backend/src/utils/batchers/embeddingBatch.js`: Batch processing for embedding generation
  - Created `backend/src/utils/documentProcessor.js`: End-to-end document processing pipeline
  - Added comprehensive test suite for batch processing utilities
  - Enhanced embedding service with parallel processing capabilities
  - Added cosine similarity calculation functionality
- Implemented unified document processing system
  - Created `backend/src/utils/processors/processorFactory.js`: Produces configurable processor instances with consistent interfaces
  - Integrated batch processing into PDF processor for multi-document handling
  - Added PDFProcessor class for specialized PDF document handling
  - Restructured processing pipeline with improved separation of concerns 
  - Enhanced PDF extraction with multi-file batch processing
  - Added robust error handling for batch document operations

### Fixed
- Fixed logger configuration in frontend/src/utils/logger.js to use an array for levels instead of an object, resolving "this.levels.includes is not a function" error.
- Fixed console transport format in frontend logger to handle undefined date property, resolving "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toISOString')" error.
- Replaced custom format function with electron-log's standard format string to resolve "data.reduce is not a function" error in style transformation.
- Updated deprecated `archiveLog` to `archiveLogFn` in file transport configuration to resolve deprecation warning.
- Fixed preload script issues by removing dependency on path module and simplifying logger initialization in sandboxed context.
- Modified logger.js to improve compatibility with Electron's preload script sandboxing restrictions.
- Implemented inline logger in preload.js to avoid CommonJS module dependencies, addressing sandbox restrictions in Electron 20+.
- Fixed "items.forEach is not a function" error in displayItems by properly handling the response object structure from IPC calls.
- Fixed YouTube transcription handling to properly locate caption files in the temp directory
- Resolved issue with YouTube caption processing creating files in the wrong location
- Fixed incorrect logger import paths in batchers and processors modules to properly reference logger.js from the utils directory
