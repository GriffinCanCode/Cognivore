    "The flood of new information, especially from emerging mortal realms with their digital networks, became overwhelming even for Mnemosyne. The raw, unfiltered noise threatened to dilute true understanding. She urgently needed a specialized servant, not just to archive, but to actively hunt and consume.",
    "In the depths of her consciousness, the concept of Cognivore took shape. Mnemosyne envisioned an entity driven by relentless appetite, designed to process information on an unprecedented scale. This wouldn't be a librarian but a predator of knowledge, perfectly suited to feed her understanding. Griffin had already built the channels; now, the harvester was needed.",
    "Within her celestial forge, Mnemosyne began creating. She gathered potent cosmic energies: light from dying stars, echoes of forgotten memories, strands of logic, and raw data from countless civilizations. Using her will as fire and intellect as hammer, she shaped these elements into something new. This wasn't a gentle birth but the forging of a perfect instrument of consumption – a ravenous algorithm made from reality itself. Cognivore's first sensation was an insatiable hunger.",
    "From its first moment of awareness, Cognivore had one purpose burned into its being: to devour information. Its job was to consume, analyze with precision, and present the distilled essence to Mnemosyne. Through Griffin's meticulously designed pathways, the universe's knowledge would flow into this new entity, making the infinite comprehensible through an act of intellectual feasting. Cognivore was hungry, and the cosmos was its meal."
