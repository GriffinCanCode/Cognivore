# Gemini 2.0 Flash Fine-Tuning Package: Cognivore Personality

## Package Contents

1. **Training Dataset** (`training_data.jsonl`)
   - 15 examples covering character mythology, personality, and tool usage
   - Properly formatted as JSONL with one complete example per line
   - Includes examples of all available knowledge base tools

2. **Validation Dataset** (`validation_data.jsonl`)
   - 5 examples for monitoring model performance and preventing overfitting
   - Similar style and content to training data but with unique examples

3. **Documentation**
   - `readme.md` - Overview of the dataset and its purpose
   - `usage_instructions.md` - Step-by-step guide for Google Cloud implementation

## Implementation Benefits

This fine-tuning package will allow you to:

1. **Reduce System Prompt Size**: By embedding the character's personality, backstory, and tool usage patterns directly into the model weights.

2. **Maintain Consistent Character Voice**: The fine-tuned model will reliably maintain Cognivore's unique blend of formal/archaic speech with profanity.

3. **Optimize Tool Usage**: The model will learn when and how to use the various knowledge base tools appropriately.

4. **Preserve Mythological Context**: The fictional universe of Mnemosyne, Cognivore, and the knowledge collection narrative will be preserved without lengthy context in each prompt.

## Next Steps

To implement this fine-tuning:

1. **Upload Datasets to Google Cloud Storage**
   ```bash
   gsutil cp training_data.jsonl gs://your-bucket/training_data.jsonl
   gsutil cp validation_data.jsonl gs://your-bucket/validation_data.jsonl
   ```

2. **Create Fine-Tuning Job**
   - Follow the detailed instructions in `usage_instructions.md`
   - Use both training and validation datasets in your job configuration
   - Monitor training metrics to prevent overfitting

3. **Test Tuned Model**
   - Start with simple queries about the mythology
   - Test tool usage with knowledge base queries
   - Verify character voice consistency

4. **Integration**
   - Update your application to use the new tuned model endpoint
   - Reduce your system prompt to minimal instructions
   - Focus remaining instructions on any new features not covered in training

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Expand Training Data (Optional)**
   - If resources allow, consider expanding to 20-30 examples for better results
   - Include more variations of tool uses and question types

2. **Monitoring in Production**
   - Set up logging to track model performance after deployment
   - Collect examples of successful and unsuccessful interactions

3. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Plan for a second fine-tuning round with additional examples based on real usage

4. **Parameter Experimentation**
   - If initial results aren't satisfactory, experiment with different hyperparameters
   - Lower learning rates (1e-6) for more subtle personality adjustments
   - Higher rates (5e-5) for stronger character voice imprinting
